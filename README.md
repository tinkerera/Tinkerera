# Hi, I'm Adem Yildirim 👋

Cloud-native and DevOps-focused engineer with a strong foundation in distributed systems and backend development.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 I'm currently a Mathematical Engineering student at Yildiz Technical University (Graduation: 2026), blending mathematical modeling with computing fundamentals.

- 💼 Working part-time as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer at **Siemens**, where I design and manage production-ready infrastructure on AWS using **Terraform**, **CloudFormation**, **Docker**, and **ECS**.

- 🔧 Previously contributed to backend and DevOps projects, focusing on:
  - Containerized service development with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**
  - CI/CD automation using **GitHub Actions**
  - Infrastructure reproducibility and system observability

- ☁️ I’m passionate about building **fault-tolerant, scalable systems** and implementing **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. I enjoy working with tools that automate system provisioning, delivery, and monitoring pipelines.

- 🛠 I’m particularly interested in:
  - **Distributed Systems** and service orchestration
  - **Cloud-native architectures** using **ECS**, **Lambda**, **Bedrock**, and event-driven patterns
  - **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** practices like alerting, autoscaling, and system health monitoring
  - **DevOps pipelines** for microservices at scale

- 🧪 Actively experimenting with:
  - **Go** for high-performance backend tools
  - **Serverless architectures** for cost-efficient, elastic services
  - **GitOps** and immutable deployment strategies
