# Hey there, I'm Adem 👋

I’m a **Software Engineer** at **Siemens** and a **Mathematical Engineering student** at **Yıldız Technical University**.

## ☁️ About Me

I’m passionate about **AI**, **backend systems**, and **cloud-native technologies**.  
Most of my time goes into designing and coding services that are **fast**, **reliable**, and **easy to scale**.
